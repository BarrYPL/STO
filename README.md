It's simle Server and BT client project where ESP32 trigger some PC shortcut based on Server's inputs array via Bluetooh and COM port.
In this example it switches desktop to right one and then switcches it back for previous one.

You are able to change the shortcut to whatever you want, but remember to resize the array if the new shortcut has a different number of keys than the current one.
